    "##### 1) Output Destination:\n",
    "The print statement outputs messages to the standard output (usually the console) by default. On the other hand, the logging module provides flexibility in directing log messages to various destinations such as files, databases, network streams, or even sending them via email."

    "##### 2) Log Levels and Severity: \n",
    "The logging module offers different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to categorize log messages based on their severity or importance. In contrast, print statements do not provide built-in mechanisms to distinguish the significance or severity of the output."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### 3) Granularity and Control: \n",
    "With the logging module, you can selectively enable or disable logging at different levels for different parts of your application, providing fine-grained control over the output. On the other hand, print statements are usually scattered throughout the code and require manual removal or commenting to control the output."

    "##### 4) Debugging and Troubleshooting:\n",
    "The logging module offers advanced features for debugging and troubleshooting, such as capturing timestamps, stack traces, and other contextual information. It provides a structured approach to log messages, aiding in identifying and resolving issues. print statements, while useful for quick debugging, lack the flexibility and built-in capabilities for in-depth analysis."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### 1) Maintainability: \n",
    "Logging provides a more organized and structured approach to capturing and managing output. It allows you to enable or disable logging statements without modifying the code, making it easier to switch between different logging configurations in different environments or during different stages of the application lifecycle."

    "Logging is designed to handle application output in production environments. It allows you to control the verbosity of log messages and select appropriate log levels based on the severity of events. This ensures that only relevant information is captured, minimizing noise in the output and improving system performance."

    "Logging generates logs in a structured format, making it easier to parse, filter, and analyze the output using various tools and libraries. Log files can be stored and archived for future reference, allowing you to track the application's behavior, troubleshoot issues, and gather insights about its performance and usage."

It supports features like log rotation, log file compression, log aggregation, and integration with external systems or monitoring tools. This scalability allows your application's logging capabilities to grow as your requirements evolve."
